## 📦 Installation

> [!WARNING]
> The install script is WIP.

> [!NOTE]
> This setup is intended for Arch-based distributions.

### Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rickinshah/niri-dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
```

### Run the install script
```bash
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

This will:

- Install all required packages from `packages.txt`.
- Set up ~/.config with symlinks.
- Create necessary folders and permissions.
- Set up systemd user services for Niri session.

## 🔧 Startup Applications

Startup applications are managed using `systemd` — as recommended in [official Niri documentation](https://github.com/YaLTeR/niri/wiki/Example-systemd-Setup)

Custom unit files are stored in: `~/.config/systemd/user`

> [!NOTE]
> Some systemd services and custom keybindings rely on scripts stored in `~/.local/bin`. Make sure it's present in your `$PATH`.

Enable services with:
```bash
systemctl --user add-wants niri.service <service>.service
```

For example:
```bash
systemctl --user add-wants niri.service waybar.service
systemctl --user add-wants niri.service avizo.service
```
